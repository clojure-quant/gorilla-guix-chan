´´´# environments
When running guix environment SOME-PACKAGES, Guix sets up a temporary environment where all the requirements for SOME-PACKAGES are exposed the environment manifest is just a Scheme code file that evaluates to a list of packages to include inside the environment. An environment is an ephemeral thing (just a process tree/container/whatever).  It spawns a subshell, exit with CTRL-D.

You can basically define a manifest and invoke it with 
guix environment --pure                         one of pure or container or nothing
                            --container
                            --share=$HOME=$HOME
                            -N                                            for containers that need network access
with --pure, you might need to preserve some env vars with -E (e.g. $DISPLAY)

Example manifest https://git.elephly.net/gitweb.cgi?p=software/mumi.git;a=blob;f=guix.scm;h=cbc5e6671efa30ebfd776f5fca1ee1e37cef779b;hb=HEAD

directly spawn the program you like with: 
guix environment -m manifest.scm
guix environment --pure        --ad-hoc jq -- jq --help
guix environment --container --ad-hoc gcc-toolchain
The option --container ensures the best possible isolation from the standard environment that your system installation and user account provide for day-to-day work. This environment contains nothing but a C compiler and a shell (which you need to type in commands), and has access to no other files than those in the current directory.

If the term "container" makes you think of Docker, note that this is something different. Note also that the option --container requires support from the Linux kernel, which may not be present on your system, or may be disabled by default. Finally, note that by default, a containerized environment has no network access, which may be a problem. If for whatever reason you cannot use --container, use --pure instead

If you’re using Intel processor, then make sure your processor has support for hardware virtualization. If it does, then make sure VT-x or VT-d extension is enabled from the BIOS of your computer

packages:  virt-manager

Indeed, it was disabled in the BIOS, after I enabled virtualisation,
/dev/kvm appeared.
